# Task-Management-System
Task Management System is a project that enable personal users to keep track of their task, 
it allow Group leaders to create a group and and assign task to any member of the group.
You can signup as personal user, group leader or group member.
Once the task is been assigned, the person you assign task to can receive email notification about the task and the due date.
I introduce celery to enable the system send reminder to the person after every two days till the due_date of the task.
